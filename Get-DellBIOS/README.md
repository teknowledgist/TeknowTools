# Get Latest Dell BIOS

This script simply downloads to the desktop the latest BIOS revision available for the model Dell computer on which it is run.  Obviously, it requires web access.

The work is done via PowerShell, but because most computers (appropriately) are protected from running "plain" PowerShell scripts, the PoSh code is buried inside a CMD file.  If you want just the PowerShell code, copy everything between the `# Start PowerShell` and `# End PowerShell` lines.
